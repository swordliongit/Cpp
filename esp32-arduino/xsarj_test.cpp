  dmd_test.cpp
   Demo and example project for the Freetronics DMD, a 512 LED matrix display
   panel arranged in a 32 x 16 layout.

  This LIibrary (DMD32) and example are  fork of original DMD library  was modified to work on ESP32
  Modified by: Khudhur Alfarhan  // Qudoren@gmail.com
  1/Oct./2020

  See http://www.freetronics.com/dmd for resources and a getting started guide.

  Note that the DMD32 library uses the VSPI port for the fastest, low overhead writing to the
  display. Keep an eye on conflicts if there are any other devices running from the same
  SPI port, and that the chip select on those devices is correctly set to be inactive
  when the DMD is being written to.

  USAGE NOTES
  -----------
  - Place the DMD library folder into the "arduino/libraries/" folder of your Arduino installation.
  - Restart the IDE.
  - In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board > and choose any ESP32 board
  - In the Arduino IDE, you can open File > Examples > DMD > dmd_demo, or dmd_clock_readout, and get it
   running straight away!

   See the documentation on Github or attached images to find the pins that should be connected to the DMD LED display


  This example code is in the public domain.
  The DMD32 library is open source (GPL), for more see DMD32.cpp and DMD32.h
